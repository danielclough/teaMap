## Introduction
Green Tea refers to the beverages made from the young leaves, called "buds" of camellia sinensis, which have not been oxidized before fixing (杀青), shaping, and drying. The color of the finished product and the brewed tea soup preserve the green color of the fresh tea leaves. Regular drinking of green tea can prevent cancer, reduce fat and lose weight, and it can also reduce the nicotine damage it receives.
